**Module 5 Glossary: Cloud Security, Monitoring, Case Studies, & Jobs**

**Access group:**
- A group of users and service IDs with shared access assigned through one or more access policies.

**Administrative users:**
- Individuals with privileges to create, update, and delete application and service instances, needing insight into team members' activities.

**API keys:**
- Unique identifiers passed into an API to identify calling applications or users.

**Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**
- Measures application availability and performance, providing tools for troubleshooting in an application's environment.

**Application users:**
- Users of cloud-hosted applications.

**AppSec:**
- Application Security.

**Audit and compliance:**
- Critical service within the identity and access framework used to validate implemented controls against policies.

**Authentication:**
- Identity service enabling applications deployed to the cloud to authenticate users at an application level.

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys):**
- Policy allowing users to bring their encryption keys.

**Client-side encryption:**
- Encryption occurring before data is sent to cloud storage.

**Cloud directory services:**
- Securely manage user profiles and associated credentials within a cloud environment.

**Cloud encryption:**
- Last line of defense, encrypting data with robust access control, key management, and certificate management.

**Cloud monitoring solutions:**
- Assess data, application, and infrastructure behaviors for performance, resource allocation, network availability, compliance, and security risks.

**Cloud security:**
- Policies, technological procedures, services, and solutions securing enterprise applications and data on the cloud.

**Database monitoring tools:**
- Track processes, queries, and availability of services to ensure accuracy and reliability of database management systems.

**Decryption key:**
- Defines how encrypted data will be transformed back to legible data.

**Developer users:**
- Authorized to read sensitive information and create, update, and delete applications.

**Encryption:**
- Scrambling data to make it illegible.

**Encryption algorithm:**
- Defines rules for transforming data to make it illegible.

**Encryption at rest:**
- Protecting data while stored.

**Encryption in transit:**
- Protecting data while transmitted from one location to another.

**Encryption in use:**
- Protecting data when in use in memory.

**Identity and access management:**
- Also known as access control, authenticates and authorizes users, providing user-specific access to cloud resources, services, and applications.

**Infrastructure monitoring tools:**
- Identify hardware failures and security gaps for corrective action before affecting user experience.

**Key management services:**
- Perform life cycle management for encryption keys used in cloud services or custom-built apps.

**KYOK (Keep Your Own Keys):**
- Policy allowing users to retain ownership of their encryption keys.

**Multifactor authentication:**
- Adds an additional layer of authentication for application users.

**Reporting:**
- Provides a user-centric view of access to resources.

**Server-side encryption:**
- Encryption occurring after cloud storage receives data but before it's written to disk and stored.

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):**
- A security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser.

**TLS (Transport Layer Security):**
- A protocol securing communication over a computer network.

**User and service access management capability:**
- Enables cloud application and service owners to provision and de-provision user profiles with minimal human interaction.
