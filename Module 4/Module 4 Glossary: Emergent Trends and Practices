**API:**
- **Definition:** Application Programming Interface

**Application modernization:**
- **Definition:** Helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics

**Cloud native application:**
- **Definition:** An application developed from the outset to work only in the cloud environment, or an existing app that has been refactored and reconfigured with cloud native principles

**Continuous delivery:**
- **Definition:** Delivering small, well-designed, high-quality increments of software to customers

**Continuous deployment:**
- **Definition:** Progressing each new packaged build through the deployment lifecycle as rapidly as possible

**Continuous integration:**
- **Definition:** Creating packaged builds of the code changes released as immutable images

**Continuous monitoring:**
- **Definition:** Monitoring with tools that help developers understand the performance and availability of their applications, even before theyâ€™re deployed to production

**Delivery pipeline:**
