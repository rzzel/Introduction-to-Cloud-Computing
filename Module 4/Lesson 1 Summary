Hybrid Multi-Cloud:
- Strategy for cloud adoption.
- Enables seamless interoperability between public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT.
- Utilizes the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.
- Aims for flexibility, efficiency, and optimization of cloud resources.
- Enhances the overall cloud computing strategy by combining multiple cloud environments.

Microservices Architecture:
- Development approach for building applications.
- Involves breaking down an application into loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services.
- Each service operates independently and communicates through well-defined APIs.
- Promotes efficiency in development, maintenance, and upgrading cycles.
- Facilitates scalability and easier management of complex applications.
- Enables continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices.

Serverless Computing:
- Computing approach that shifts infrastructure management tasks to cloud providers.
- Developers focus on coding, testing, and deployment without dealing with infrastructure provisioning, maintenance, and scaling.
- Execution of functions or services on a pay-as-you-go model.
- Ideal for event-driven applications and services.
- Reduces operational overhead and allows for better resource utilization.
- Enhances developer productivity by abstracting infrastructure complexities.
