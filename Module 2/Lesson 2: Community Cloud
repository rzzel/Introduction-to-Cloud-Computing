Definition of Community Cloud:
- NIST SP 800-145 Definition:
  - Cloud infrastructure provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers with shared concerns.
  - May be owned, managed, and operated by organizations in the community, a third party, or a combination.
  - Can exist on or off premises.

Reasons for Community Cloud Approach:
- Shared Security Controls: Community cloud members operate under the same set of security controls.
- Attributes Consistency: Provides members with consistent attributes like citizenship and authorization controls.
- Data Localization: Supports data localization and data sovereignty based on the location of the community cloudâ€™s data centers.
- Perimeter Security Model: Defines a perimeter security model for the entire community cloud.

Software-Defined Community Cloud Implementation:
- Legacy vs. Modern Approach: Legacy community clouds rely on physical separation, while modern architecture emphasizes a software-defined approach.
- Google Cloud's Assured Clouds: Utilizes a software-defined approach referred to as "assured clouds."
  - Defines communities, separates projects, and allows configuration changes based on policy.

Comparison: Traditional vs. Software-Defined Community Cloud:
| Characteristic | NIST Definition SP 800-145 | Traditional Cloud Community Implementation | Software-Defined Community Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure Exclusivity | Cloud infrastructure is for exclusive use by a specific community | Separate data centers with separate infrastructure | Each project is effectively a private cloud with isolated infrastructure primitives |
| Security Controls | Same security controls apply across exclusive infrastructure shared by the community | All users subject to common security controls | Assured Workloads controls scoped to the community |
| Personhood and Citizenship of Support Staff | May be owned, managed, and operated by organizations, a third party, or a combination | Personnel must be physically located at dedicated facilities | Access management service restricts support to personnel with required attributes |
| Data Localization | May exist on or off premises | Community dedicated storage devices enforced by software | Enforced by software |
| Defined Security Parameter | Implied | The community is the enclave | Each project is its own enclave |

Software-Defined Community Cloud as a "Government Cloud" in Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
- Project Definition:
  - In GCP, a project is a logical grouping of infrastructure primitives.
  - Infrastructure primitives are atomic units of capacity, such as VMs, persistent disks, storage buckets, etc.
- Private Cloud Deployment Model:
  - NIST SP 800-145 defines private cloud as provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization.
  - In GCP, each project is an individual project separate from others, creating enclaves.

Benefits of Software-Defined Community Cloud:
- Security and Compliance: Meets security and compliance requirements.
- Rapid Onboarding: Faster onboarding of new hardware, services, and improvements.
- Efficiency Improvement: Improved overall efficiency due to the scale of infrastructure available.
- Quick Implementation of Security Enhancements: Security enhancements can be scaled and implemented more quickly.
