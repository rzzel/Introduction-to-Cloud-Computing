  - Can be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.

3. Hybrid Cloud:
- Structure:
  - Combination of on-premise private cloud and a third-party public cloud.
- Integration:
  - Connected to form a single, flexible infrastructure.
- Benefits:
  - Leverages features and benefits of both public and private clouds.

4. Community Cloud:
- Community Provisioning:
  - Provider provisions cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns.
- Ownership and Operation:
  - One or more organizations, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for ownership, management, and operation.
