- CDNs: Content Delivery Networks deliver cached copies of website content to users based on geographic location.
- Cloud Region: A geographic area where a Cloud provider's infrastructure is clustered.
- Containers: Executable units of software packaging application code, libraries, and dependencies for portability.
- Data center: A large room or warehouse containing cloud infrastructure.
- Dedicated hosts: Offer single-tenant isolation.
- Direct Attached storage: Storage presented directly to a cloud-based server, within the host server chassis or rack.
- File storage: Presented as 'NFS Storage,' connected to compute nodes over a standard Ethernet network.
- Hosted hypervisor: Hypervisor with a layer of host OS between the physical server and hypervisor.
- HPC: High-Performance Computing.
- Hypervisor: Software running above the physical server or host.
- IOPS: Input/Output Operations Per Second, indicating disk speed for read and write operations.
- NFS: Network File Storage.
- Object storage: Storage not attached to a compute node, accessed via an API.
- Reserved virtual server: Instances allowing reservation of capacity and guaranteeing resources for future deployments.
- SDN: Software Defined Networking.
- Shared or Public Cloud VMs: Provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments provisioned on-demand.
- Transient or Spot VMs: Utilize unused capacity in a cloud data center.
- Virtualization: Process of creating a virtual version of compute, storage, networking, servers, or applications.
