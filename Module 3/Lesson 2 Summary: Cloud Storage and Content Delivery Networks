Cloud Storage Types:
1. Direct Attached (Local) Storage:
   - Presentation: Directly to a cloud-based server.
   - Location: Within the host server chassis or the same rack.
   - Characteristics: Directly accessible, limited scalability.

2. File Storage:
   - Presentation: As Network File System (NFS) to compute nodes.
   - Connectivity: Over standard Ethernet network.
   - Characteristics: Suitable for file-based data, moderate scalability.

3. Block Storage:
   - Presentation: Via high-speed fiber connections, provisioned in volumes.
   - Connectivity: Directly mounted onto compute nodes.
   - Characteristics: High-speed access, suitable for databases, scalable volumes.

4. Object Storage:
   - Presentation: Accessed via API, no need for an underlying compute node.
   - Characteristics: Infinite capacity, pay-as-you-go pricing, slower read/write speeds.
   - Use Cases: Well-suited for scalable, unstructured data, and archival storage.

Object Storage Details:
- Infinite Capacity:
  - Allows continuous addition of files with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- Read/Write Speeds:
  - Slower compared to other storage types.

Content Delivery Network (CDN):
- Definition:
  - A distributed server network accelerating internet content delivery.
  
- Function:
  - Delivers cached copies of website or media content based on users' geographic location.

- Benefits:
  - Accelerates content delivery, reduces latency.
  
- Implementation:
  - Temporarily stores or caches copies of content.
