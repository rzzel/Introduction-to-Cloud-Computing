Cloud Infrastructure Components:

- Data Centers:
  - Core facilities hosting computing resources.

- Storage:
  - Repository for data, files, and other information.

- Networking Components:
  - Infrastructure facilitating communication between resources.

- Computing Resources:
  - Processing power, including virtual machines (VMs) and bare metal servers.

Virtualization:

- Definition:
  - Creating a software-based version of physical resources.

- Hypervisors:
  - Enables virtualization by managing and creating VMs.

Types of Virtual Machines (VMs):

1. Shared or Public Cloud VMs:
   - Provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments.
   - On-demand provisioning with predefined sizes.

2. Transient or Spot VMs:
   - Utilize unused capacity in a cloud data center.

3. Reserved VMs:
   - Allow capacity reservation, guaranteeing resources for future deployments.

4. Dedicated Hosts:
   - Offer single-tenant isolation.

Bare Metal Servers:

- Definition:
  - Single-tenant physical servers dedicated to a single customer.

- Use Cases:
  - Ideal for high-performance computing (HPC) and data-intensive applications.
  - Suited for applications with high security or compliance requirements.

Cloud Networking:

- Delivery as a Service:
  - Networking capabilities provided as services instead of rack-mounted devices.

- Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs):
  - Subnets housing VMs, storage, network connectivity, and load balancers.

- Subnets:
  - Private and public subnets for secure deployment of multi-tier applications.

- Load Balancers:
  - Distribute traffic, ensuring responsive applications.

Containers:

- Definition:
  - Executable units of software packaging application code, libraries, and dependencies.

- Portability:
  - Run anywhere, from desktops to the cloud.

- Advantages:
  - Lightweight, resource-efficient.
  - Streamline development and deployment of cloud-native applications.
